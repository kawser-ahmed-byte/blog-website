            US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, on his latest mission to rein
            in the Gaza offensive, told <span>Israeli leaders yesterday there was
            still a chance of winning acceptance from their Arab neighbours</span>, if
            they create a path to a viable Palestinian state. On his fourth trip
            to the region since October in a so far largely fruitless quest to
            tamp down the violence, Blinken said he would share what he had
            heard in two days of talks with Jordan, Qatar, the United Arab
            Emirates and Saudi Arabia. The Israeli offensive has killed 23,210
            Palestinians so far, destroyed much of Gaza and displaced most of
            the population of 2.3 million at least once, creating a dramatic and
            worsening humanitarian crisis.
